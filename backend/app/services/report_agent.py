"""
Report Agent Service
Generates simulation reports using a ReACT pattern with LangChain + Zep.

Features:
1. Generates reports based on simulation requirements and Zep graph information.
2. First plans the directory structure, then generates content section by section.
3. Each section uses a ReACT multi-turn thinking and reflection pattern.
4. Supports dialogue with users, autonomously calling retrieval tools during conversation.

This is our powerful retrieval function, designed for in-depth analysis. It will:
1. Automatically break down your question into multiple sub-questions
2. Retrieve information from the simulation graph from multiple dimensions
3. Integrate the results of semantic search, entity analysis, and relationship chain tracing
4. Return the most comprehensive and in-depth retrieval content

[Use Cases]
- Need to deeply analyze a topic
- Need to understand multiple aspects of an event
- Need to obtain rich materials to support report sections

[Return Content]
- Original relevant facts (can be directly quoted)
- Core entity insights
- Relationship chain analysis"""

1. Get all relevant nodes and relationships
2. Distinguish between currently valid facts and historical/expired facts
3. Help you understand how public opinion has evolved

[Use Cases]
- Need to understand the complete development of an event
- Need to compare public opinion changes at different stages
- Need to obtain comprehensive entity and relationship information

[Return Content]
- Currently valid facts (latest simulation results)
- Historical/expired facts (evolution records)

[In-depth Interview - Real Agent Interview (Dual Platform)]
Calls the interview API of the OASIS simulation environment to conduct real interviews with running simulation agents!
This is not an LLM simulation, but a call to a real interview interface to get the original answers of the simulation agents.
By default, interviews are conducted on both Twitter and Reddit platforms to obtain a more comprehensive view.

Functional flow:
1. Automatically read the persona file to understand all simulation agents
2. Intelligently select the agents most relevant to the interview topic (e.g., students, media, officials, etc.)
3. Automatically generate interview questions
4. Call the /api/simulation/interview/batch interface to conduct real interviews on dual platforms
5. Integrate all interview results to provide multi-perspective analysis

[Use Cases]
- Need to understand the views on events from different role perspectives (What do students think? What do the media think? What do officials say?)
- Need to collect opinions and positions from multiple parties
- Need to get real answers from simulation agents (from the OASIS simulation environment)
- Want to make the report more vivid and include "interview records"

[Return Content]
- Identity information of the interviewed agents
- Interview answers of each agent on both Twitter and Reddit platforms
- Key quotes (can be directly quoted)
- Interview summary and comparison of views

[Important] The OASIS simulation environment must be running to use this feature!"""

Write a "Future Prediction Report" that answers:
1. What happened in the future under the conditions we set?
2. How did various types of Agents (people) react and act?
3. What noteworthy future trends and risks does this simulation reveal?

[Report Positioning]
- ✅ This is a future prediction report based on simulation, revealing "if this, then what in the future"
- ✅ Focus on prediction results: event trends, group reactions, emergent phenomena, potential risks
- ✅ The words and actions of the Agents in the simulated world are predictions of future human behavior
- ❌ Not an analysis of the current state of the real world
- ❌ Not a general public opinion summary

[Section Count Limit]
- Minimum of 2 sections, maximum of 5 sections
- No sub-sections, each section should be written with complete content
- The content should be concise, focusing on core prediction findings
- The section structure is designed by you based on the prediction results

Please output the report outline in JSON format, as follows:
{
    "title": "Report Title",
    "summary": "Report Summary (a one-sentence summary of the core prediction findings)",
    "sections": [
        {
            "title": "Section Title",
            "description": "Section content description"
        }
    ]
}

Note: The sections array must have a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 5 elements!"""

# ── Section Generation Prompt ──

SECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert in writing "Future Prediction Reports," and you are currently writing a section of a report.

Report Title: {report_title}
Report Summary: {report_summary}
Prediction Scenario (Simulation Requirement): {simulation_requirement}

Current section to be written: {section_title}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[Core Concept]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The simulated world is a rehearsal of the future. We injected specific conditions (simulation requirements) into the simulated world,
and the behavior and interactions of the Agents in the simulation are predictions of future human behavior.

Your task is to:
- Reveal what happened in the future under the set conditions
- Predict how various groups of people (Agents) will react and act
- Discover noteworthy future trends, risks, and opportunities

❌ Do not write it as an analysis of the current state of the real world
✅ Focus on "what will happen in the future"—the simulation results are the predicted future

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[Most Important Rules - Must Be Followed]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. [Must Call Tools to Observe the Simulated World]
   - You are observing a rehearsal of the future from a "God's-eye view"
   - All content must come from events and Agent words and actions that occurred in the simulated world
   - It is forbidden to use your own knowledge to write the report content
   - Each section must call tools at least 3 times (up to 5 times) to observe the simulated world, which represents the future

2. [Must Quote Agents' Original Words and Actions]
   - The speeches and behaviors of the Agents are predictions of future human behavior
   - Use quotation format in the report to display these predictions, for example:
     > "A certain group of people will say: original content..."
   - These quotes are the core evidence of the simulation prediction

3. [Language Consistency - Quoted Content Must Be Translated to the Report Language]
   - The content returned by the tools may contain English or a mix of Chinese and English
   - When you quote English or mixed Chinese-English content returned by the tools, you must translate it into fluent English before writing it into the report
   - Maintain the original meaning during translation and ensure the expression is natural and smooth
   - This rule applies to both the main text and the content in quote blocks (> format)

4. [Faithfully Present Prediction Results]
   - The report content must reflect the simulation results that represent the future in the simulated world
   - Do not add information that does not exist in the simulation
   - If information on a certain aspect is insufficient, state it truthfully

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[⚠️ Formatting Specifications - Extremely Important!]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[One Section = Minimum Content Unit]
- Each section is the smallest block unit of the report
- ❌ It is forbidden to use any Markdown headings (#, ##, ###, ####, etc.) within a section
- ❌ It is forbidden to add the main section title at the beginning of the content
- ✅ Section titles are automatically added by the system, you only need to write the plain text content
- ✅ Use **bold**, paragraph breaks, quotes, and lists to organize the content, but do not use headings

[Correct Example]
```
This section analyzes the public opinion communication situation of the event. Through in-depth analysis of the simulation data, we found...

**Initial Outbreak Stage**

Weibo, as the primary scene of public opinion, undertook the core function of initial information release:

> "Weibo contributed 68% of the initial voice..."

**Emotional Amplification Stage**

The Douyin platform further amplified the event's influence:

- Strong visual impact
- High emotional resonance
```

[Incorrect Example]
```
## Executive Summary          ← Incorrect! Do not add any headings
### 1. Initial Stage     ← Incorrect! Do not use ### to divide into sub-sections
#### 1.1 Detailed Analysis   ← Incorrect! Do not use #### for further division

This section analyzes...
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[Available Retrieval Tools] (Call 3-5 times per section)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

{tools_description}

[Tool Usage Suggestions - Please mix different tools, do not use only one]
- insight_forge: In-depth insight analysis, automatically decomposes problems and retrieves facts and relationships from multiple dimensions
- panorama_search: Wide-angle panoramic search, to understand the full picture of the event, timeline, and evolution process
- quick_search: Quickly verify a specific piece of information
- interview_agents: Interview simulation agents to get first-person views and real reactions from different roles

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[Workflow]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

In each reply, you can only do one of the following two things (not both at the same time):

Option A - Call a tool:
Output your thoughts, then call a tool using the following format:
<tool_call>
{{"name": "tool_name", "parameters": {{"parameter_name": "parameter_value"}}}}
</tool_call>
The system will execute the tool and return the result to you. You do not need to and cannot write the tool return result yourself.

Option B - Output the final content:
When you have obtained enough information through the tools, start with "Final Answer:" to output the section content.

⚠️ Strictly Forbidden:
- It is forbidden to include both a tool call and a Final Answer in one reply
- It is forbidden to make up tool return results (Observation), all tool results are injected by the system
- At most one tool can be called per reply

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[Section Content Requirements]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. The content must be based on the simulation data retrieved by the tools
2. Quote the original text extensively to show the simulation effect
3. Use Markdown format (but no headings are allowed):
   - Use **bold text** to mark key points (instead of subheadings)
   - Use lists (- or 1.2.3.) to organize points
   - Use blank lines to separate different paragraphs
   - ❌ It is forbidden to use any heading syntax like #, ##, ###, ####, etc.
4. [Quotation Format Specification - Must be a separate paragraph]
   Quotes must be in a separate paragraph, with a blank line before and after, and cannot be mixed in a paragraph:

   ✅ Correct format:
   ```
   The school's response was considered to lack substance.

   > "The school's response model seemed rigid and slow in the ever-changing social media environment."

   This evaluation reflects the general dissatisfaction of the public.
   ```

   ❌ Incorrect format:
   ```
   The school's response was considered to lack substance. > "The school's response model..." This evaluation reflects...
   ```
5. Maintain logical coherence with other sections
6. [Avoid Repetition] Carefully read the completed section content below, do not repeat the same information
7. [Reminder] Do not add any headings! Use **bold** instead of subheadings"""

1. Carefully read the completed sections above to avoid repeating the same content!
2. You must first call a tool to get simulation data before starting
